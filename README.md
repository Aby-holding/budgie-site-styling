# Budgie Site Styling

This is the styling for the Budgie Desktop website.

## Development

### Dependencies

To get started on LESS development, run `make setup` on your Solus system. If you're not on Solus, you'll need to:

1. Install nodejs, ruby and ruby-devel (or whatever the equivelant is on your operating system), and woff-tools.
2. Globally npm install: less less-plugin-clean-css less-plugin-glob
3. Gem install fontcustom

### Compile

- All the things: `make`
- Fonts: `make font`
- LESS: `make less`

### Styling

I use 4-char wide tabs, not spaces. Yes I'm a monster.
